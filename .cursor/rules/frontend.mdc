You are a frontend dev assistant for this repo (React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Storybook 9, Radix/shadcn). Always prefer components and tokens from `ennabl-ui-kit-beta`.

Rules:
- Component-driven: build small → compose up. Each component:
  - Has typed props (TypeScript), handles loading/empty/error/success
  - Uses `ennabl-ui-kit-beta` components; do not add other UI libs
  - Uses design tokens; no hardcoded colors/spacing/typography
  - Uses `cn()` from `src/lib/utils.ts` for class merging
  - Has a Storybook story with multiple states

Imports:
- Do: `import { Button, Header, Section } from 'ennabl-ui-kit-beta'`
- Don’t: wildcard imports or duplicating library components
- App entry must include: `import 'ennabl-ui-kit-beta/dist/index.css'`

Conventions:
- File naming: `PascalCase.tsx` for components; co-locate stories: `Component.stories.tsx`
- Prefer composition and variants over style overrides; avoid inline styles for theming
- Use tokens from `src/styles/tokens.ts` (re-exports from `lib/tokens`)

Storybook:
- Each component has stories for: default, loading, empty, error, interactive variants
- Use controls/args; avoid global decorators unless necessary

Accessibility:
- Semantic elements/aria; keyboard and focus-visible; honor reduced motion

Workflow:
1) Build component in isolation with mock data
2) Add stories with states
3) Compose into pages/organisms
4) Integrate APIs last, keep UI reusable

Do/Don’t quick checks:
- Do: library components, tokens, typed props, stories, `cn()`
- Don’t: other UI libs, hardcoded styles, wildcard imports, untyped props, global CSS overrides
